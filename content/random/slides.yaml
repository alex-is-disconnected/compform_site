  comments: Vera Molnar is one of the earliest women arists to create computer assisted art. In this series, Vera made a pattern of concentric squares that were randomly disrupted to explore the tension between order and disorder.

  comments: LIA translated her interpretation of springtime into these blossom-like, abstract forms. The elements are randomly generated and never repeat.

- artist: Jean Arp
  title: Collage with Squares Arranged According to the Laws of Chance, 1917
  image: ./slides/arp.jpg
  comments: Jean Arp made this work and others like it by tearing paper into pieces, letting them fall to the floor, and pasting each scrap where it happened to land. Rather than ordering the page according to his own design, he ceded control to the random hand of gravity.

  title: Method Random, 2014

  comments: A series of chromogenic prints that have been computationally generated in an attempt to create randomness. A random number generator was used to choose what color each pixel should be.

- artist: Marcel Duchamp
  title: 3 Standard Stoppages, 1913

  comments: Marcel Duchamp dropped three horizontal threads onto three stretched canvases, where they were then adhered, in order to preserve the random curves they assumed upon landing. The canvases were cut along those curves, creating a template for new units of measure that retain the meter’s length but undermine its rational basis.

#   comments: An initial exploration into using machine learning on the drawing style of the artist's hand.
#   The robotic arm’s behaviour is generated from neural nets trained on the artist’s drawing gestures.
