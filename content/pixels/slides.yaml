  comments: Jon Corbett created a single channel video that shows four generations of his Cree-Métis heritage by animating a sequence of spiralled portraits starting with his grandmother, grandfather, himself, and his son. Each portrait rendered slowly to the screen by a computational algorithm that selects a colour from a source image, generates a 3D pixel in a 3D image space, and then digitally “sews” this bead to the screen.
