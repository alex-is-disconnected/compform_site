  comments: In 1972, Aaron Marcus created his first “computer-assisted poem-drawings”. Using standard typographical symbols, Marcus experimented with a photo-typesetting machine connected to a digital computer, reordering the symbols and their uses to create new meanings. The works were then printed as lithographs and serigraphs.
